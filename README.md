# nissan_ecu_hacking
Python code written to utilize the Korlan usb2can hardware to send and receive data over the can-bus on a 2008 Nissan 350z

I highly recommend checking out the Resources directory. Theres a 2008 Nissan 350z Service and Repair manual in there as well as can bus codes I've discovered (and a link to more)

The long term goal for this project is to have a display(conencted to a raspberry pi that connects to OBDII via usb) in my 350z where the upper center console is (I don't have the NAV model).
On this display I want to have metrics and graphs and such, maybe an integration with a gps module and Waze or something similar. 

Once I reach that stage I'll be uploading wiring diagrams and write-ups for my process incase someone wants to replicate it.

I'm sure main.py will be renamed, split up into more files, etc. as time goes along.
